title: "OnOrderTrace()"
pathName: /docs/desktop/onordertrace

## Definition

An event driven method used for strategies which will allow you to customize the output of [TraceOrders](/docs/desktop/traceorders).

{% callout type="warning" %}
Overriding this method will disable the default order tracing that is generated by the NinjaTrader core. It is then up to you to pass the message generated to the NinjaTrader [output window](/docs/desktop/output) using the [Print()](/docs/desktop/print) method. Generally, overriding this method is not required.
{% /callout %}

## Method Return Value

This method does not return a value.

### Syntax

You must override the method in your strategy with the following syntax:

```csharp
protected override void OnOrderTrace(DateTime timestamp, string message)
{

}
```

## Method Parameters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| timestamp | The time that the order trace was generated |
| message | The message that is generated |

## Examples

```csharp
protected override void OnOrderTrace(DateTime timestamp, string message)
{
    // The below print would give us the default tracing
    Print(string.Format("{0} {1}", timestamp, message));
    // The extended example would also include the instrument fullname from our primary bars object
    if (BarsArray[0] != null)
        Print(string.Format("{0} {1} {2}", timestamp, message, BarsArray[0].Instrument.FullName));
}
```

If you create a NinjaScript indicator or strategy with many customizable parameters, you will have a long label when you load the NinjaScript onto your chart. This may be visually cumbersome, so you may want to trim the displayed label to a more manageable size that only contains the most important parameters.

## Key concepts in this example:

- Creating a custom string for the label of the NinjaScript item.

When adding an indicator onto a chart, you can also completely remove any labeling on the chart of the indicator name. You can do this by clearing the "Label" field under the "General" category when you add the indicator onto the chart.

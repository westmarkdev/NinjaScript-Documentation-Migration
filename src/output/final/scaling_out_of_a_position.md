A common technique used by discretionary traders is scaling in and scaling out of a position. To scale out of a position refers to closing a portion of your position when you hit a profit target and then raising your stop to close your remaining portion later.

## Key concepts in this example

- Submitting Profit Target orders

- Submitting Trailing Stop orders

- Closing half of your position at a time

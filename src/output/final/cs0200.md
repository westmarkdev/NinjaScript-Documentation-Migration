The following CS0200 error code information is provided within the context of NinjaScript. The examples provided are only a subset of potential problems that this error code may reflect. In any case, the examples below provide a reference of coding flaw possibilities.

## Error Code Explanation

This error is most common when you try to assign values to a particular [Series&lt;t&gt;](/docs/desktop/seriest) index that is read-only. Instead, try making your own [Series&lt;t&gt;](/docs/desktop/seriest) and assign the value there.

### Error Description

Property or indexer 'NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.ISeries<double>.this[int]' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only

## Example #1

// Erroneous Sample Code - Cannot assign values to something that is read-only

Close[0] = 25;

// Resolution Sample Code - Assigns value to a custom Series<double>

myCustomClose[0] = 25;

## Example #2

// Erroneous Sample Code - Cannot reassign values to Series<double> indexed value and cannot have an if statement based
// on an assignment operator

if (Close[0] = Open[0])

// Resolution Sample Code - Properly compares two Series<double> values

if (Close[0] == Open[0])

NinjaScript allows you to develop custom strategies in rapid time by using over 100 built-in system indicators, 3rd party indicators or [custom indicators](/docs/desktop/developing_indicators). NinjaScript strategies are compiled and run natively within the NinjaScript application providing the highest performance possible.

Please take the time to review this section including the [Strategy Development Process](/docs/desktop/the_strategy_development_process).

Prior to running strategies live, please be sure to review the sections about [Strategy Position vs. Account Position](/docs/desktop/strategy_position_vs_account_p) and [Syncing Account Positions](/docs/desktop/syncing_account_positions).

## Tutorial Descriptions

All internal NinjaScript indicators and sample strategies come with full source code and can be viewed within the NinjaScript [Editor](/docs/desktop/editor). Please review the tutorials within this section for detailed walk throughs of custom strategy development.

## Definition

The SystemPerformance object holds all trades and trade performance data generated by a strategy.

{% callout type="note" %}
• A NinjaScript strategy can generate both synthetic trades (historical backtest trades) and real-time trades executed on a real-time data stream. If you wish to access only real-time trades, access the "RealTimeTrades" collection.
• The first trade of the "RealTimeTrades" collection will contain a synthetic entry execution if the strategy was NOT flat at the time you start the strategy.
• These properties require that [IncludeTradeHistoryInBacktest](/docs/desktop/includetradehistoryinbacktest) be set to true.
{% /callout %}

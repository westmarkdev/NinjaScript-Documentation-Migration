The Strategies tab displays running and terminated strategies in a [data grid](data_grids.htm).

| Note: The [IncludeTradeHistoryInBacktest](includetradehistoryinbacktest.htm) property is set to false by default when a strategy is applied directly in the Strategies tab. This provides for leaner memory usage, but at the expense of not being able to access Trade objects for historical trades. Thus, fields such as [SystemPerformance.AllTrades.Count](alltrades.htm) that rely on references Trade objects will not have any such references to work with. If you would like to save these objects for reference in your code, you can set IncludeTradeHistoryInBacktest to true in the Configure state. For more information, see the [Working with Historical Trade Data](strategyanalyzer_properties_2.htm) page. |

| Strategy Performance
While the [Account Performance](trade_performance.htm) tab will generate performance report against your account's trade history, the Strategy Performance menu allows you to generate a performance report against the trades generated by the selected strategy.
 
ControlCenter_Strategies_StrategyPerformance
 
•Real-time - Generates performance data for your real-time trades only (since the strategy started running) and will exclude historical trades. If your strategy held a virtual position (calculated against historical data) upon starting, a virtual execution representing the average price of this position will be injected into the real-time results to ensure that a trade pair can be created with the executions resulting from the closing of this position.•Historical &amp; Real-time - Generates performance data for both historical and real-time trade data.•Historical - Generates performance data for historical data only. |

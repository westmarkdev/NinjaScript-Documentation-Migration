## Error Code Explanation

Strings cannot be compared with relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=) to other object types. Strings can only be compared to other strings and only through the use of equality operators (==, !=).

### Error Description #1

## Operator '==' cannot be applied to operands of type 'string' and 'int'

// Erroneous Sample Code – Cannot compare a string to an integer

```csharp
if ("string" == 5)
```

// Resolution Sample Code – Compare a string with another string

```csharp
if ("string" == intValue.ToString());
```

### Error Description #2

## Operator ‘<’ cannot be applied to operands of type ‘string’ and ‘double’

// Erroneous Sample Code - Cannot compare a string to a double

```csharp
if ("string" >= 1.2)
```

// Resolution Sample Code - Testing to see if the strings are not the same

```csharp
if ("string" != "string2")
```

### Error Description #3

## Operator ‘>’ cannot be applied to operands of type ‘string’ and ‘string’

// Erroneous Sample Code - Cannot quantitatively compare a string to another string

```csharp
if ("string" > "string2")
```

// Resolution Sample Code - Testing to see if both strings are the same

```csharp
if ("string" == "string2")
```

### Additional Error Descriptions

## Definition

The **SystemPerformance** object holds all trades and trade performance data generated by a strategy.

{% callout type="note" %}

Notes:

* A **NinjaScript** strategy can generate both synthetic trades (historical backtest trades) and real-time trades executed on a real-time data stream. If you wish to access only real-time trades, access the **RealTimeTrades** collection.
* The first trade of the **RealTimeTrades** collection will contain a synthetic entry execution if the strategy was NOT flat at the time you start the strategy.
* These properties require that [IncludeTradeHistoryInBacktest](includetradehistoryinbacktest) be set to true.

## Definition

An event driven method used for strategies which will allow you to customize the output of **TraceOrders**.

{% callout type="warning" %}

Warning: Overriding this method will disable the default order tracing that is generated by the NinjaTrader core. It is then up to you to pass the message generated to the NinjaTrader **output window** using the **Print()** method. Generally, overriding this method is not required.

{% /callout %}

## Method Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Syntax

You must override the method in your strategy with the following syntax:

**protected override void OnOrderTrace(DateTime timestamp, string message)**

## Method Parameters

{% table %}

---

* **timestamp**
* The time that the order trace was generated

---

* **message**
* The message that is generated
{% /table %}

## Examples

```csharp
protected override void OnOrderTrace(DateTime timestamp, string message)
{
   // The below print would give us the default tracing
   Print(string.Format("{0} {1}", timestamp, message));
 
   // The extended example would also include the instrument fullname from our primary bars object
   if (BarsArray[0] != null)
       Print(string.Format("{0} {1} {2}", timestamp, message, BarsArray[0].Instrument.FullName));
}
```

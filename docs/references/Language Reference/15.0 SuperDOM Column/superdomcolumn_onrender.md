## Definition

Used to draw custom content to the SuperDOM Column, such as a Grid.

This method is called during the following conditions:

* The SuperDOM is centered (either automatically or when the user presses the Center button)
* The SuperDOM is scrolled
* All accounts are disconnected
* A simulation account is reset
* A position is updated
* The user changes the SuperDOM's properties through the Properties menu
* The SuperDOM first loads (e.g. restoring from a workspace)
* The user changes the PnL display unit by clicking on the Position display
* The height/width of the SuperDOM window changes
* A user resizes the content area by dragging the splitter between price ladder and the columns

{% callout type="note" %}

Note: While similar to a Chart Indicator's **OnRender()** method, the SuperDOM Column uses **WPF Drawing Context** [DrawingContext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.drawingcontext(v=vs.110).aspx) class, rather than the SharpDX library used for **chart rendering** [rendering](rendering). Concepts between these two methods are guaranteed to be different.

{% /callout %}

## Method Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Syntax

You must override the method in your SuperDOM column with the following syntax:

**protected override void OnRender(DrawingContext dc, double renderWidth)**

## Method Parameters

{% table %}

* Name

* Description

---

* dc

* The drawing context [DrawingContext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.drawingcontext(v=vs.110).aspx) for the column

---

* renderWidth

* The rendering width for the column

---

{% /table %}

{% callout type="note" %}

In order to force **OnRender()** to be called under a specific condition, call the **OnPropertyChanged()** method which will force the entire column to repaint. This approach should be used instead of calling **OnRender()** directly.

{% /callout %}

## Examples

```csharp
protected override void OnRender(DrawingContext dc, double renderWidth)
{
 Â  // Rendering logic for our column
}
```

The following CS0200 error code information is provided within the context of NinjaScript. The examples provided are only a subset of potential problems that this error code may reflect. In any case, the examples below provide a reference of coding flaw possibilities.

## Error Code Explanation

This error is most common when you try to assign values to a particular **Series`<t>`** index that is read-only. Instead try making your own [Series<`t`>](seriest) and assign the value there.

## Error Description

Property or indexer '**NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.ISeries`<double>`.this[int]**' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only

## Examples

### Example #1

{% callout type="note" %}

Erroneous Sample Code - Cannot assign values to something that is read-only

{% /callout %}

```csharp
Close[0] = 25;
```

{% callout type="note" %}

Resolution Sample Code - Assigns value to a custom Series<`double`>

{% /callout %}

```csharp
myCustomClose[0] = 25;
```

### Example #2

{% callout type="note" %}

Erroneous Sample Code - Cannot reassign values to Series<`double`> indexed value and cannot have an if statement based on an assignment operator

{% /callout %}

```csharp
if (Close[0] = Open[0]) 
```

{% callout type="note" %}

Resolution Sample Code - Properly compares two Series<`double`> values

{% /callout %}

```csharp
if (Close[0] == Open[0]) 
```

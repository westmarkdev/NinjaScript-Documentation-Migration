## Compiling

The indicator code is now complete and needs to be compiled. You can compile this indicator by selecting the Compile menu item from within the **NinjaScript Editor** Right Click, by clicking the Compile icon on the toolbar at the top of the window, or by pressing the **F5** key on your keyboard. It is important to understand that this process makes the indicator ready for real-time use natively within **NinjaTrader**. It does not run as interpreted code, as many other applications do, but rather as a **C#** assembly. This provides you with the highest performance possible. If there are any errors reported during compiling, the error messages will be displayed at the bottom of the **NinjaScript Editor**.

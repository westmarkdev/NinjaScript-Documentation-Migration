## Compiling

The indicator code is now complete and needs to be compiled. You can compile this indicator from within the **NinjaScript Editor** right mouse button menu "Compile" menu or simply press the **F5** key. It is important to understand that this process makes the indicator ready for real-time use and will run natively within **NinjaTrader** directly. It does not run interpreted as many other applications do. This provides you with the highest performance possible. If there are any errors reported during compiling, the error messages will be displayed at the bottom of the **NinjaScript Editor**.

At times you may have a need to monitor the stop-loss and profit target orders generated by the **SetStopLoss()**, **SetTrailStop()** or **SetProfitTarget()** methods. You can accomplish this by capturing their unique Order object as the **OnOrderUpdate()** method is called and process them into a collection for future referencing.

## Key concepts in this example

* Monitoring stop-loss order states

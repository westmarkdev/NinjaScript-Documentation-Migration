An essential element of any trader's strategies or indicators is time. You may find yourself wanting a high and low marker for a certain timeframe or you might want something drawn on your charts during those choppy lunch hours. **DateTime** objects are included in the .NET framework, and they can be used to do any time related action, like limiting trading hours or finding the highest high between 9:30AM and 10:30AM.

## Modifying the price of stop loss and profit target orders

One of the benefits of **NinjaScript** is the ability to automatically submit stop loss and profit target orders in real-time triggered when your entry order is filled.

### Key concepts in this example

* Submitting a stop loss and profit target order using default values offset from your entry order average fill price
* Modification of the stop loss order to a break even price once a desired level of profit has been reached

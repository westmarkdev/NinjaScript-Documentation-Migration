NinjaScript allows you to develop custom strategies in rapid time by using over 100 built-in system indicators, 3rd party indicators or **custom indicators**. NinjaScript strategies are compiled and run natively within the NinjaScript application providing the highest performance possible.

Please take the time to review this section including the [Strategy Development Process](the_strategy_development_process).

Prior to running strategies live, please be sure to review the sections about [Strategy Position vs. Account Position](strategy_position_vs_account_p) and [Syncing Account Positions](syncing_account_positions).

## Tutorial Descriptions

All internal NinjaScript indicators and sample strategies come with full source code and can be viewed within the NinjaScript **Editor**. Please review the tutorials within this section for detailed walk throughs of custom strategy development.
